Framework for making ZeppOS apps. I made this because I wanted an app that would show me real-time time table for exacly three bus stops and I didn't like the API ðŸ™‚.

Stuff that works:

- Works both on ZeppOS and on web (with small exception for navigation, which works but uses different API)
- Layout (Row, Column and Stack)
- State management and UI updates
- Preserving z-index
- Animations (usually look pretty bad on watch, but may be usefull for small components - `ActivityIndicator` works suprisingly well)
- Simple navigation
- Touch events
- Text
- Arc
- Border
